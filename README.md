Hello, Drew here
Currently trying to educate myself through Hackreactor and other developer platforms to become a developer, any advice is greatly appreciated. I have no coding expirience what so ever but I enjoy the challenge of learning code so far and hope to be able to apply what I will learn here to either internet security like CISCO and such or possibly take it in a more creative direction and design websites for Start up businesses or work for a marketing firm.
